#About the Maker Lab

<p>The Maker Lab in the Humanities at the <a title="learn more" href="http://www.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">University of Victoria</a> opened its doors in September 2012 under the direction of <a title="learn more" href="http://www.jenterysayers.com/" target="_blank">Jentery Sayers</a> (Assistant Professor, English). With research priority areas in <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/physcomp/">physical computing</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/fab/">desktop fabrication</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/versions/">versioning</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/exhibits/">scholarly exhibits</a>, it intersects cultural criticism, computation, and comparative media studies with tacit learning, multimodal communication, and experimental methods. As the Lab&#8217;s name suggests, its design is anchored in blending a humanities research lab with a collaborative makerspace&#8212;a design that affords its <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/people/">team</a> of graduate students and faculty opportunities to build <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/projects/">projects</a> through various modes of knowing by doing (e.g., programming, markup, data modeling, 3D printing, speculative design, prototyping, and new media production).</p>
<h4>About &#8220;Maker&#8221; and &#8220;Making&#8221; in the Humanities</h4>
<p>The Maker Lab&#8217;s approach to the humanities is influenced by popular makerspaces and maker faires as well as fields like experimental art, interaction design, and media archaeology. That said, its use of &#8220;maker&#8221; and &#8220;making&#8221; understands both words on a broad spectrum, to include writing and composition in addition to tinkering, coding, crafting, bending, prototyping, and fabricating (among many others). The Lab also resists impulses to reduce technical work and tacit learning to practices in &#8220;service&#8221; of scholarship. By extension, the Maker Lab is necessarily invested in the layered materiality of history, culture, media, and research. All of its <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/projects/">projects</a> engage the complex intersections between print and electronics,  the digital and the analog, the persistent and the ephemeral.</p>
