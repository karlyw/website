#Desktop Fabrication Research

<p>Desktop fabrication technologies, including 3D printers, are becoming increasingly accessible to many consumers in Canada, the United States, and beyond. Typical representations of these technologies frame them as clip art machines for the 21st century or devices intended largely for hobbyists. However, in the Maker Lab, we are mobilizing desktop fabrication for cultural research to create critical objects (e.g., relief maps) that do not exist in the world. Inspired by the work of researchers like Tara McPherson, Anne Balsamo, and Sharon Daniel, we are also invested in making scholarly arguments through tacit knowledge, new materialities, and mixed media, which correspond and diversify with the essay-based communications of the humanities. To be sure, fabrication technologies not only underscore how (to borrow from Neil Gershenfeld) digital programmability influences analog dynamics and tangible objects. They also put pressure on humanities practitioners to unpack the social and cultural implications of digital/material convergence. For instance, how can desktop fab help us reduce e-waste and resist planned obsolescence? How can printing scholarly objects in 3D inform existing practices in data visualization and screen-oriented design? What editorial and copyright decisions are involved in replication? How does fabrication shape our engagements with historical artifacts and material culture? How can, or should, we use 3D printing to reassert the value of conjecture and speculation in the humanities? Of tacit learning and praxis in fields like history, literary criticism, and media studies? </p>
<p>This research (scheduled for 2013-17) is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, in collaboration with the <a title="learn more" href="http://williamjturkel.net/2013/02/02/the-history-department-with-a-fab-lab/" target="_blank">Humanistic Fab Lab at Western</a>.</p>
<h4>Our Desktop Fabrication Projects</h4>
<p>The following Maker Lab projects currently involve desktop fabrication: <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/makerspace/">The Humanities Lab as Makerspace</a>, the <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hello/">&#8220;Hello World&#8221; Workshop Series</a>, and Kits for Cultural History (details coming soon). Additionally, some <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hastac/">HASTAC Scholars at UVic</a> practice desktop fabrication.</p>
