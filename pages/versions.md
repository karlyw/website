#Versioning Research

<p>Following research by scholars like Matthew Kirschenbaum and Lev Manovich, we might say that distinctions between originals and copies are giving way to versions, or the bundles of variants emerging across multiple instances of a given object. Versioning is of course central to software development and revision control. But how might practices in these domains correspond with our understanding of literary and cultural production? How do you &#8220;version&#8221; a novel or a poem, especially when you did not write it? Or, across witnesses of a text, what kinds of variants ultimately matter? How do we express that variance and render it legible to audiences unfamiliar with versioning? What roles might new media&#8212;such as data visualizations and video games&#8212;play in this expression?</p>
<p>With questions like these in mind, the Maker Lab is collaborating with the <a title="learn more" href="http://mvp.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Modernist Versions Project (MVP)</a> in addition to the <a title="learn more" href="http://scalar.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Scalar</a> development team to research methods for versioning in humanities contexts. Ultimately, we are interested not only in the intersections between software studies and writing but also in how change or difference is identified, understood, and expressed through computational culture. From our perspective, such an inquiry necessarily integrates literary and cultural history into a larger framework of comparative media studies, with attention to what materially persists and fades over time, across media shifts (e.g., from the codex to the screen).</p>
<p>This research (scheduled for 2012-15) is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. To conduct this work, we are relying on many existing tools and platforms, including Scalar, Juxta, and Mandala, as well as <a title="learn more" href="https://github.com/danielcarter/jquery.modVers" target="_blank">modVers</a>, which is being built by Tanya Clement and Daniel Carter, both members of the MVP team.</p>
<h4>Our Versioning Projects</h4>
<p>The following Maker Lab projects currently involve versioning: <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/mod/">Versioning Modernism</a>, the <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hello/">&#8220;Hello World&#8221; Workshop Series</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/you/">Year of <em>Ulysses</em></a>. Additionally, some <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hastac/">HASTAC Scholars at UVic</a> are conducting research on versioning, particularly in the context of modernism.</p>
