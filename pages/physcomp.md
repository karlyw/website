#Physical Computing Research

 <p>One of the Maker Lab&#8217;s primary research areas is humanities physical computing, or the construction of interactive systems that put digital and analog materials into conversation. At the core of this research is an investment in the data that cultural practices routinely produce (often unbeknownst to their practitioners). For instance, in magazines, journals, videos, and books (by people like Bruce Sterling and Tom Igoe), we see the use of microcontrollers to make coffee machines tweet and books report their geolocation&#8212;a veritable Internet of Things. But how is this seemingly banal development of smart objects socially embedded? How might humanities practitioners use physical computing to, say, better understand the cultural and economic assumptions that enable both our habits and our research? To shift our attention away from screens and construct new sorts of humanities interfaces? To facilitate a stronger awareness of computational mechanisms, electronics, media history, and experimental methods? With an emphasis on collaborative building and humanities-based praxis, these are the kinds of questions we ask in the Lab. And&#8212;with the <a title="learn more" href="http://williamjturkel.net/2013/02/02/the-history-department-with-a-fab-lab/" target="_blank">Humanistic Fab Lab at Western</a>&#8212;we are currently making humanities physical computing kits for cultural inquiry. In so doing, we are learning a lot from fields like media art, electronic music, interaction design, and science and technology studies.</p>
<p>This research (scheduled for 2013-17) is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Prior to 2013, the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a> at UVic helped spark humanities physical computing research on campus through its support of the Humanities Physical Computing Research Group (consisting of Alyssa Arbuckle, UVic English; Ted Hiebert, UWB IAS; Doug Jarvis, Independent Artist; Joel Legassie, UVic History; Shaun Macpherson, UVic English; Alyssa McLeod, UVic English; Jana Millar Usiskin, UVic English; Daniel Powell, UVic English; Jentery Sayers, UVic English; Emily Smith, UVic English; Michael Stevens, UVic English; and Tara Thomson, UVic English), which was active during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 academic years.</p>
<h4>Our Physical Computing Projects</h4>
<p>The following Maker Lab projects currently involve physical computing: <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/makerspace/">The Humanities Lab as Makerspace</a>, the <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hello/">&#8220;Hello World&#8221; Workshop Series</a>, and Kits for Cultural History (details coming soon). Additionally, many <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hastac/">HASTAC Scholars at UVic</a> practice physical computing.</p>
