#Exhibit Research

<p>Across its projects, the Maker Lab is invested in the correspondences between online and offline interactions. For our research on scholarly exhibits, we collaborate with cultural heritage institutions (like university libraries) to interpret special collections through digital and analog approaches, websites included. This work is engaging because it underscores how contexts, media types, and interfaces influence the ways in which audiences interpret cultural materials. It also highlights the various modes through which culture is designed, archived, and discovered. But for us&#8212;right now&#8212;it is perhaps most important because it insists on the relevance of physical place, face-to-face interaction, tacit learning, and conviviality in a digital economy. Echoing the work of Jonathan Sterne, exhibits become a way of thinking about &#8220;convivial&#8221; computing in our current moment, interpreting and making culture through platforms, protocols, and materials that persist beyond the ostensible ephemerality and attention accumulation of the present.</p>
<p>Our exhibit research involves collaborations with University of Victoria Libraries, University of Washington Libraries, and the <a title="learn more" href="http://mvp.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Modernist Versions Project</a>. This research (scheduled for 2012-17) is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and intersects with our ongoing <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/fab/">desktop fabrication</a> and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/physcomp/">physical computing</a> research. Online components of our exhibit research are built using WordPress, Git, GitHub, CONTENTdm, and <a title="learn more" href="http://scalar.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Scalar</a>. In partnership with the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture and practitioners at the University of Southern California, the Maker Lab is particularly invested in building exhibits with Scalar.</p>
<h4>Our Exhibits</h4>
<p>The following Maker Lab projects currently involve the construction of exhibits: <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/croc/">the Crocodile Cafe Exhibit</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/brown/">the Audrey Alexandra Brown Exhibit</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/ulysses/">the Long Now of <em>Ulysses</em></a>. Additionally, some <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hastac/">HASTAC Scholars at UVic</a> are building exhibits with Scalar and other platforms.  </p>
