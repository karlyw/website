#How to Make a New Post 

##Select "+ New"

Enter title and body of post, add any links or media that you want to appear directly in the body of the post. 

Underneath the title is a line that says "Permalink" with a url following. Edit the url so that after "maker.uvic.ca/" there is only one word, like "maker.uvic.ca/post"

At the end of your post, hit "Return," then say:

"Post by YourName Here, attached to the WhicheverWhatever project(s), with the whichever tag(s). Featured image(s) for this post care of whereveryougotit."

Add a link to your name that will lead to your archive page (maker.uvic.ca/author/yourfirstname), and link the project and tag to their archive pages as well. 

Make sure you then select whichever projects you identified for the post from the "Categories" bar on the right. Please don't add your own category! 

Also select tags for the post from the "Tags" bar below "Categories." Click the "Choose from the most used tags" option and select which ones you want to use from there. Please do not invent your own tags!


*DO NOT SELECT A FEATURED IMAGE YET* That comes later.  

Pay no attention to Shortcodes

##Post Format

Select post format: Select either "Gallery" if it's a regular post (you will need at least two images), or "Video" if it's a video post. 

If a Gallery post, upload the images you're using (at least two) into the "Attached gallerys" section that will pop up. This will add your images to the rest of the media selections on the site. 

*Upload the images in order.* The one you want to appear first MUST be uploaded first, the one you want to scroll to second must be uploaded second, etc. 

THEN go to the feature image window on the right side of the page and select one of your images as your "featured image." 

*DO NOT select an image as your featured image before you upload the ones you want to use.*

Scroll up to the "Publish" bar on the right side, "Preview" if you want to check out your post. Underneath the "Save Draft" button, there is a line that says "Status: Draft" - Click "Edit" and change this to say "Pending Review." 

Then click "Save as Pending" and you're done! 

##FIN.
