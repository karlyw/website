#Workshop: Using Juxta to Identify Textual Variants

Nov. 16, 2012

<p>The Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria is happy to announce the second in a series of seven &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops during 2012-13. The workshops are made possible by support from the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> and the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a>. Below is a description of the second workshop: &#8220;Collating Your Texts: Using Juxta to Identify Textual Variants.&#8221; It will be facilitated by Stephen Ross and J. Matthew Huculak (English) on Friday, November 23rd at 12:30pm in TEF 243. A poster for the event is <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/ross_huculak.pdf?b4e08e" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to circulate the poster&#8217;s URL and this announcement.</p>
<p>An extension of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops are intended for graduate students at UVic, giving them opportunities to get their hands dirty in digital methods unfamiliar to them. The facilitators assume no technical competencies or previous experience with the workshop material. All workshops last approximately one hour and are open to the first eight graduate students who email maker@uvic.ca to register. Should demand exceed workshop capacity, the Maker Lab will keep a wait list of interested students. Just prior to the workshop, it will also contact all registrants by email in order to confirm attendance and provide workshop details (e.g., what materials, if any, registrants should bring to the workshop). Please contact the Maker Lab&#8217;s director, Jentery Sayers (maker@uvic.ca), with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>This workshop introduces participants to the Juxta collation tool. We will spend the first few minutes discussing genetic criticism. In the remaining time, we will walk through the process of using Juxta to ingest texts, identify variants, and visualize differences.
