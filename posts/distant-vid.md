<p>This workshop will introduce ProseVis, a tool that allows readers to discover aural features across literary texts. A SEASR tool, ProseVis makes prosodic features of literary texts discoverable by overlaying data produced by OpenMary, a text-to-speech application tool for extracting aural features and instance-based predictive modeling features as color codes on the original text.</p>
