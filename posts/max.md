#Workshop: Introduction to Visual Programming

Nov. 5, 2012

 <p>The Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria is happy to announce the first in a series of seven &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops during 2012-13. The workshops are made possible by support from the <a title="to the dhsi" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> and the <a title="to the etcl" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a>. Below is a description of the first workshop: &#8220;Max/MSP: An Introduction to Visual Programming.&#8221; It will be facilitated by <a title="to shaun's page" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/shaun/" target="_blank">Shaun Macpherson</a> (English) on Wednesday, November 7th at 3:30 in TEF 243. A poster for the event is <a title="to the poster" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/macpherson.pdf?b4e08e" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to circulate the poster&#8217;s URL and this announcement.</p>
<p>An extension of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops are intended for graduate students at UVic, giving them opportunities to get their hands dirty in digital methods unfamiliar to them. The facilitators assume no technical competencies or previous experience with the workshop material. All workshops last approximately one hour and are open to the first eight graduate students who email maker@uvic.ca to register. Should demand exceed workshop capacity, the Maker Lab will keep a wait list of interested students. Just prior to the workshop, it will also contact all registrants by email in order to confirm attendance and provide workshop details (e.g., what materials, if any, registrants should bring to the workshop). Please contact the Maker Lab&#8217;s director, Jentery Sayers (maker@uvic.ca), with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Max/MSP is a visual programming language used for creating music, video, and other media. In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of Max/MSP and MIDI communication and construct a small patch related to some form of media. Participants will need to bring a laptop and have installed the Max/MSP demo ahead of time. (Installation details will be emailed to registrants prior to the workshop.) To register, email <a title="email maker@uvic" href="mailto:maker@uvic.ca" target="_blank">maker@uvic.ca</a>.</p>
