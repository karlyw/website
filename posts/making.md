#Making Space / Maker Spaces

April 9, 2013

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Change life!&#8217; &#8216;Change society!&#8217; These precepts mean nothing without the production of an appropriate space.&#8221; So says Henri Lefebvre. Quite rightly too, I think. I can almost hear the proverbial head of the nail responding &#8220;ouch!&#8221; But to these &#8216;precepts&#8217; I suggest we add a third, similarly unthinkable without the development of and access to conducive spaces: change research!</p>
<p>We here at the Maker Lab recently responded to <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/better_life-vie_meilleure-eng.aspx">SSHRC&#8217;s call for video/ multi-media proposals, Research for a Better Life</a>. Collaboratively, we put together and submitted two videos: one outlining <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/jana/">Jana&#8217;s digital literary exhibit on Audrey Alexandra Brown</a>, the other less focused on a particular project and more generally proposing the need for shared collaborative spaces for graduate student research. Along with everyone else who worked on the video &#8212; Jana, Nina, Mikka, Shaun, Ad√®le, Katie, and Alex &#8212; I&#8217;m extremely proud to say that Jana&#8217;s video &#8220;Recovering the Local&#8221; was selected as <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/meet_the_top_25-allez_a_la_rencontre_des_25_finalistes-eng.aspx">one of the 25 finalists</a> in the competition (SSHRC has suggested we not distribute the video until they publish it on their website; i.e. embedded link= forthcoming). Curiously, though collaboration was crucial to the production of both videos, it was the video that outlined an individual scholar&#8217;s project that won, while the more overtly collaborative proposal was, sadly, turned away. Actually, in planning, filming, producing, and editing &#8220;Recovering the Local,&#8221; we often felt the need to minimize the appearance of its collaborative production. So we omitted the Maker Lab logo, and we decided against including all of our names in the closing credits &#8212; understandably, since SSHRC&#8217;s call for proposals seemed explicitly geared toward single-scholar projects.</p>
<p>I think Jana is brilliant; her work is great, her project is important, and the video communicates these things. In other words, she deserves this. But this experience leaves me with the feeling that collaborative research continues to be met with some resistance in the humanities.</p>
<p>For the other video we asked <a href="http://nowviskie.org/">Bethany Nowviskie</a>, <a href="http://makerspace.ca/">Derek Jacoby</a>, and <a href="http://www.karikraus.com/?page_id=167">Kari Kraus</a>  to help articulate the need for collaborative work spaces in the humanities. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bethany-clip.mp4">Bethany</a><br />
<a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Sequence-01.mp4">Derek Jacoby</a><br />
<a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kari-Kraus.mp4">Kari Kraus</a></p>
<p>These videos articulate better than I can the imperative need for shared spaces and collaborative research in the humanities. With research centers like the <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/">Scholars&#8217; Lab</a> (note: scholar<em>s</em>, plural) at Virginia, William Turkel&#8217;s <a href="http://williamjturkel.net/2013/02/02/the-history-department-with-a-fab-lab/">Fab Lab</a> at Western, and now our very own Maker Lab, DH is, thankfully, moving in this direction. Like any good Marxist, Lefebvre would agree that the material conditions under which we conduct research profoundly effect that research &#8212; in quality and in kind. SSHRC&#8217;s Research for a Better Life competition was aptly named, but if we want to change humanities research &#8212; make it more collaborative, make it communicate with a larger audience &#8212; we need conducive spaces and collaborative work environments. Otherwise, like the precepts &#8216;change life&#8217; and &#8216;change society&#8217; for Lefebvre, our own plea &#8212; &#8216;change research!&#8217; &#8212; will mean nothing.</p>
