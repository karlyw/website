#Workshop: Distant Listening

Feb. 27, 2013

<p>The Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria is happy to announce the fifth in a series of seven &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops during 2012-13. The workshops are made possible by support from the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> and the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a>. Below is a description of our fifth workshop: &#8220;Distant Listening: Discovering Sound Patterns with ProseVis.&#8221; It will be facilitated by <a title="learn more" href="http://tanyaclement.org/" target="_blank">Tanya Clement</a> (Assistant Professor, School of Information, University of Texas at Austin) on Wednesday, March 6th, 3-4 pm, in TEF 243 (the Maker Lab). A poster for the event is <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/clement.pdf?b4e08e" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to circulate the poster&#8217;s URL and this announcement.</p>
<p>An extension of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops are intended for graduate students at UVic, giving them opportunities to get their hands dirty in digital methods unfamiliar to them. The facilitators assume no technical competencies or previous experience with the workshop material. All workshops last approximately one hour and are open to the first eight graduate students who email maker@uvic.ca to register. Should demand exceed workshop capacity, the Maker Lab will keep a wait list of interested students. Just prior to the workshop, it will also contact all registrants by email in order to confirm attendance and provide workshop details (e.g., what materials, if any, registrants should bring to the workshop). Please contact the Maker Lab&#8217;s director, Jentery Sayers (maker@uvic.ca), with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>This workshop will introduce ProseVis, a tool that allows readers to discover aural features across literary texts. A SEASR tool, ProseVis makes prosodic features of literary texts discoverable by overlaying data produced by OpenMary, a text-to-speech application tool for extracting aural features and instance-based predictive modeling features as color codes on the original text. To register, email <a title="email maker" href="mailto:maker@uvic.ca">maker@uvic.ca</a>.</p>
