# Slidedeck for TEMiC 2013 Keynote
Jentery Sayers on August 9, 2013   SerialMonograph  

<p>Last week, I had the wonderful opportunity to give a talk at <a title="learn more" href="http://editingmodernism.ca/training/summer-institutes/temic/" target="_blank">Textual Editing and Modernism in Canada (TEMiC) 2013</a> (University of British Columbia, Okanagan), co-directed by Karis Shearer and Dean Irvine. The event&#8217;s theme, &#8220;Editing Modernism On and Off the Page,&#8221; was an engaging one, intersecting media and material culture studies with literary and textual studies. In conversation with the theme, my talk—&#8221;Editing, Annotating, and Discovering Historical Audio&#8221;—addressed how researchers might best integrate digital audio into scholarly monographs and journals, and I ended with a best case scenario of sorts, outlining the features of an ideal scholarly audio tool (informed in part by Jonathan Sterne&#8217;s recent work) for multimodal authoring and publication platforms like Scalar and Omeka.</p>

<p>Beginning with an overview of my current book project, <em>How Text Lost Its Source: Magnetic Recording Cultures</em>, the talk also unpacked why the materiality of historical audio&#8212;its physical particulars, its affordances for listening and playback, its modes of storage and circulation, and its embeddedness in labor conditions&#8212;is so central to my work. Framed as an archaeology of magnetic impressions, the overview gave me a chance to walk the audience through a brief (and certainly not exhaustive) history of magnetic audio, playing a few sound clips from across the 20th century. In so doing, I underscored how this history of magnetic audio is a history of how sounds are actively <em>made </em>by both people and machines (e.g., through editing techniques as well as historically contingent power dynamics), not simply taken, given, or captured.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Karis, Dean, and EMiC for inviting me to speak. I had a wonderful time at TEMiC 2013, and I&#8217;m looking forward to continuing the conversations we started there.</p>
<p>During 2013-14, the Lab will be further researching the integration of audio and other dynamic media into scholarly communications (especially web-based monographs), and we&#8217;ll be publishing more posts related to <em>How Text Lost Its Source </em>and the cultural history of magnetic recording. Project details soon, likely in September or October. Thank you for your patience!</p>
