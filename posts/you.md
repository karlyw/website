#Year of Ulysses 

<p>In collaboration with the Maker Lab, the Modernist Versions Project’s Year of <em>Ulysses</em> (YoU) initiative introduces James Joyce’s masterpiece to its widest audience ever, provokes people to read it, supports them as they do so, and brings this novel of the everyday back into everyday life. Thanks to the remarkable efforts of MVP associates Patrick Belk and Matthew Kochis (both at the University of Tulsa) as well as the generosity of the McFarlin Library, the MVP now owns high-quality scans of the first edition of <em>Ulysses</em> as it was published in February 1922 by Sylvia Beach’s famed Shakespeare &amp; Company bookstore. In the spirit of the <a title="Liberate Ulysses" href="http://liberateulysses.com/" target="_blank">Liberate <em>Ulysses</em></a> </em>movement and in honour of the 90th birthday of Joyce’s masterpiece, the MVP and the Maker Lab are serially publishing these scans online—just as <em>Ulysses</em> was originally serialized in the pages of the <em>Little Review—</em>and providing a robust framework for (re)discovering the novel. YoU involves not only the public release of these scans but also lectures, Twitter chats, an art competition, and various other events anchored in Joyce’s novel. Join us as we celebrate 90 years of <em>Ulysses</em>!</p>
<h4>Contributors, Support, and Partnerships</h4>
<p>Organized largely by the Modernist Versions Project (MVP) and its director, Stephen Ross, Year of <em>Ulysses</em> (YoU) involves well over fifty contributors, all of whom are listed on the <a title="learn more" href="http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/" target="_blank">MVP&#8217;s website</a>, which was originally designed by Clea Cosmann with support from the Maker Lab. During the initiative, the Lab is maintaining and visualizing data gathered from YoU-related communications, and it is providing the MVP with basic infrastructure support. In and beyond the Lab, Amanda Hansen is facilitating all lectures, Twitter chats, communications, and research related to the initiative. YoU<em> </em>would not be possible without support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the University of Victoria&#8217;s Work Study Program, and the University of Tulsa&#8217;s McFarlin Library.</p>
<h4>Project Status</h4>
<p>Year of <em>Ulysses</em> (YoU)<em> </em>began in June 2012, and regular activities will continue through June 2013, when the Maker Lab will begin aggregating materials emerging from the initiative, contextualizing them, interpreting them, and bundling them together&#8212;in a single, multimodal publication&#8212;for public use and remix. This publication is scheduled for release in 2014. </p>
