#Sayers and Turkel Awarded SSHRC Grant

May 24, 2013

<p>The Maker Lab is very happy to announce that Jentery Sayers and <a title="learn more" href="http://williamjturkel.net/" target="_blank">William J. Turkel</a> (Western University) have been awarded a <a title="learn more" href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/umbrella_programs-programme_cadre/insight-savoir-eng.aspx" target="_blank">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant</a> to fund &#8220;Humanities Physical Computing and Fabrication for Cultural History&#8221; for a four-year term (2013-17). The grant will support a team of at least seven practitioners (including Sayers and Turkel) conducting physical computing and desktop fabrication research across the University of Victoria and Western University campuses. The support will also allow the team to present their research at conferences, acquire necessary supplies, partner with like-minded researchers (including the <a title="learn more" href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/" target="_blank">Simpson Center for the Humanities</a> at the UW and the <a title="learn more" href="http://meta.viu.ca/lab/" target="_blank">MeTA Lab</a> at VIU), and facilitate public events dedicated to tacit learning, collaboration, and experimentation.</p>
<p>Details about this four-year project are forthcoming and will be published at maker.uvic.ca. Generally speaking, the research is dedicated to mobilizing physical computing and fabrication knowledge through open-source &#8220;kits,&#8221; or bundles of source code, component parts, prototypes, and process documentation intended to introduce humanities scholars and other interested audiences to the creation and distribution of 3D content according to scholarly recommendations. The central claims of the research are that: 1) <span class="pullquote">matter is a new medium for knowledge production in the humanities</span>, and 2) desktop fabrication and physical computing are central to the future of the past in 3D. Again, details are forthcoming, and the research team will be regularly publishing logs of their work here, on the Maker Lab&#8217;s website. Thank you for checking in!</p>
