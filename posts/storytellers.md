<p>The Lab&#8217;s winning video, &#8220;Recovering the Local: A Digital Literary Exhibit on Audrey Alexandra Brown&#8221; (above) details the <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/brown/">Audrey Alexandra Brown Exhibit project</a>, which is scheduled to launch this year. About that project, Jana Millar Usiskin says the following: &#8220;Women&#8217;s voices have historically been overlooked in a national context. It&#8217;s important to use new media to recover local women&#8217;s voices in order to reshape contemporary understanding of national history and culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The winning &#8220;Research for a Better Life&#8221; videos were unveiled in a cascade from coast to coast, starting April 2 in Newfoundland and ending May 21 with the four University of Victoria videos ahead of <a title="learn more" href="http://uviccongress2013.ca/" target="_blank">Congress 2013</a> next month. UVic and Ryerson were the only universities with four winners each. During Congress 2013, the UVic students will join the other winners in an exclusive research communications workshop as well as a three-minute storytellers pitch at the heart of an expo event space. They will compete for an opportunity to travel to the international social sciences forum in Montreal this October.
