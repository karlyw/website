#Processing Politics

<p>Do I produce research that I don’t know about?</p>
<p>In my last post, I attempted to think through gamification as tool for revealing systems of labor. My provisional goal was to reclaim gaming as a concept that exposes the systems that underpin our work, rather than a method used to interpellate us into those systems. For me, gameful design helps crack open the often-complicated relationship between the work we do and the infrastructures on which that work relies.</p>
<p>But mapping gameful design onto systems of scholarly labor clings to a dated understanding of authorship. When I generate content in a digital environment, the materials I produce are no longer solely my own. My workflow generates information that is reused and repurposed elsewhere. My research methods, expressed as data packages that migrate and propagate across networked systems, produce metadata that I do not always intend.</p>
<p>Should Google be cited as a co-author for this post?</p>
<p>In the lab, I’ve been tacitly approaching my research methods as zones that expose the slippage between process and product. My research processes rely on corporate and physical infrastructures; they move through servers connected by telecommunications infrastructures. To what extent does my position within these systems reproduce my positionality within the academy, within geopolitical structures, and in histories of violent dispossession? How are my research processes themselves politicized as they move through material cables and servers, and the geographic and historical contexts for that infrastructure?</p>
<p>I am now attempting to understand research in networked environments as a performative act.   My labor processes not only produce content of which I am unaware, but also reproduce my positionality within historical, geographic, and political structures. Does this suggest I can do no more than point out the politicization of my research while continuing to employ the same methods? How can my research operate as an act of resistance?</p>
