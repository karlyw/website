#Workshop: How to Data Model an Object

Jan. 20, 2013

<div class="attached_imgs_gallery"></div><p>The Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria is happy to announce the third in a series of seven &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops during 2012-13. The workshops are made possible by support from the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> and the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a>. Below is a description of our third workshop: &#8220;How to Data Model an Object.&#8221; It will be facilitated by <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/jana/">Jana Millar Usiskin</a> (English) on Thursday, January 24th, from 3 to 4 p.m., in TEF 243 (the Maker Lab). A poster for the event is <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/millarusiskin.pdf?b4e08e" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to circulate the poster&#8217;s URL and this announcement.</p>
<p>An extension of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops are intended for graduate students at UVic, giving them opportunities to get their hands dirty in digital methods unfamiliar to them. The facilitators assume no technical competencies or previous experience with the workshop material. All workshops last approximately one hour and are open to the first eight graduate students who email maker@uvic.ca to register. Should demand exceed workshop capacity, the Maker Lab will keep a wait list of interested students. Just prior to the workshop, it will also contact all registrants by email in order to confirm attendance and provide workshop details (e.g., what materials, if any, registrants should bring to the workshop). Please contact the Maker Lab&#8217;s director, Jentery Sayers (maker@uvic.ca), with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>How are objects expressed as data? We&#8217;ll use the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) to explore how we might describe objects for discovery online. Participants are encouraged to bring a familiar, physical object they want to model. To register, email <a title="email maker" href="mailto:maker@uvic.ca">maker@uvic.ca</a>.</p>
