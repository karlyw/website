<p dir="ltr">Extending the <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hello/">“Hello World” workshop series</a> supported by the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL)</a>, the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a>, and the Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria (UVic), “Building Public Humanities” is a series of free and informal workshops intended primarily for humanities graduate students. The workshops respond to an important yet often overlooked issue at the intersection of public humanities and digital humanities, namely the demand for digital projects not only responsive to current social, cultural, and political issues but also invested in mobilizing knowledge within and beyond the academy. Recognizing that such mobilization demands approaches all too rare in many humanities graduate programs, the workshops give participants at UVic a concrete sense of how to plan, prototype, develop, revise, and assess public digital projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Topics for the workshops include problem-based modeling, speaking for/with community partners, building and sharing process narratives, producing interoperable data and documentation, social justice action planning, and project management. And each event is anchored in both game studies and&#8212;to borrow a term from Matt Ratto&#8212;<a title="learn more" href="http://criticalmaking.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;critical making,&#8221;</a> two areas the Maker Lab identified as pivotal to the trajectories of digital public humanities. Importantly, the construction and delivery of the workshops relies on a broad range of expertise and a wide array of investments that allow the interprofessional series to draw from generative differences across perspectives and practices. Given the lack of a certificate or degree program in public humanities at UVic, the series also draws upon the expertise of <a title="learn more" href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/about/administration/miriam-bartha" target="_blank">Miriam Bartha</a> (co-director of the Certificate in Public Scholarship at University of Washington&#8217;s <a title="learn more" href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/" target="_blank">Simpson Center for the Humanities</a>), who is the series’ 2013-14 visiting scholar.</p>
