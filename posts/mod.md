#Versioning Modernism

<p>In partnership with the <a title="learn more" href="http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/" target="_blank">Modernist Versions Project</a> (MVP), the Maker Lab aims to advance the potential for comparative interpretations of modernist texts that exist in multiple witnesses by digitizing, collating, versioning, and visualizing them individually and in combination. According to the MVP, the primary mission of this project is to enable new critical insights that are difficult without computation. Working with established digital humanities research teams both within and beyond Canada, the MVP and Maker Lab are helping establish a set of best practices&#8212;as well as building the necessary tools, workflows, and resources&#8212;to allow scholars to digitize modernist texts, compare multiple witnesses, markup the variants, and display the results in an agile and extensible way. To this end, the Maker Lab assists MVP researchers with the markup, design, visualization, and interpretation of meaningful variants across modernist texts. It also helps the MVP articulate various ways of studying and expressing versions, through tools such as <a title="learn more" href="https://github.com/danielcarter/jquery.modVers" target="_blank">modVers</a> (built by MVP researchers Tanya Clement and Daniel Carter) as well as through gaming, revision control, and text analysis.</p>
<h4>Contributors, Support, and Partnerships</h4>
<p>Versioning Modernism is conducted in collaboration with the Modernist Versions Project, which&#8212;under the direction of Stephen Ross&#8212;partners with <a title="learn more" href="http://inke.ca/" target="_blank">Implementing New Knowledge Environments</a> (INKE) and many other scholarly groups and projects. The research is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and versioning researchers in the Lab include Adèle Barclay, Alex Christie, Adam Hammond, Jana Millar Usiskin, Stephen Ross, Jentery Sayers, and Katie Tanigawa, who are collaborating with the following MVP members: Daniel Carter (University of Texas at Austin), Tanya Clement (University of Texas at Austin), James Gifford (Fairleigh Dickinson University), J. Matthew Huculak (University of Victoria), Dean Irvine (Dalhousie University), and Susan Schreibman (Trinity College, Dublin).</p>
<h4>Project Status</h4>
<p>Contributors to Versioning Modernism (scheduled for 2012-15) are currently surveying, testing, and building tools for versioning modernist texts by authors such as Joseph Conrad, Wyndham Lewis, Marianne Moore, and Marcel Proust. The tools include modVers, Juxta, the Versioning Machine, Modernist Commons, and Git. To stay in the loop with Versioning Modernism in the Lab, follow the stream of posts below. We do our best to regularly publish logs of our work. Please do not hesitate to either comment on a log or email <a title="email the lab" href="mailto:maker@uvic.ca">maker@uvic.ca</a> with suggestions.</p>
