#Workshop: Stitching 2D into 3D

April 6, 2013

<p>The Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria is happy to announce its final &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshop for the 2012-13 academic year. The workshops are made possible by support from the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> and the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a>. Below is a description of our final workshop, &#8220;Stitching 2D into 3D: An Introduction to Photogrammetry.&#8221; It will be facilitated by <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/admin/" target="_blank">Jentery Sayers</a> (English) on Thursday, April 11th, from 3 to 4 p.m., in TEF 243 (the Maker Lab). A poster for the event is <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/sayers.pdf?b4e08e" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to circulate the poster&#8217;s URL and this announcement.</p>
<p>An extension of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; workshops are intended for graduate students at UVic, giving them opportunities to get their hands dirty in digital methods unfamiliar to them. The facilitators assume no technical competencies or previous experience with the workshop material. All workshops last approximately one hour and are open to the first eight graduate students who email maker@uvic.ca to register. Should demand exceed workshop capacity, the Maker Lab will keep a wait list of interested students. Just prior to the workshop, it will also contact all registrants by email in order to confirm attendance and provide workshop details (e.g., what materials, if any, registrants should bring to the workshop). Please contact the Maker Lab&#8217;s director, Jentery Sayers (maker@uvic.ca), with any questions or concerns.</p>
