<p>Max/MSP is a visual programming language used for creating music, video, and other media. In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of Max/MSP and MIDI communication and construct a small patch related to some form of media. Participants will need to bring a laptop and have installed the Max/MSP demo ahead of time. (Installation details will be emailed to registrants prior to the workshop.)</p>
